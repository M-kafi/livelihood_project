			A blog, or weblog, is often a mixture of what is happening in a person's life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people.
		</p>
		<p>
		People maintained blogs long before the term was coined, but the trend gained momentum with 
		the introduction of automated published systems, most notably Blogger at blogger.com. Thousands 
		of people use services such as Blogger to simplify and accelerate the publishing process.
		</p>
		<p>
		Blogs are alternatively called web logs or weblogs. However, "blog" seems less likely to cause 
		confusion, as "web log" can also mean a server's log files.
